1. canister is controlled by 3 cases
a. A single developer or a group of developers control the canister. In this case, the control over the canister is centralized, and any trust placed in the canister is dependent on the trust in the controllers. This is the default state when a new project is deployed on the Internet Computer.

b. The canister is controlled by another canister. With this approach, any type of governance system can be designed. The canister can still be upgraded, but the control over it can be decentralized.

c. The canister has no controller. This is the ultimate solution to ensure that a canister will never be upgraded. In this scenario, a canister is similar to a traditional smart contract
